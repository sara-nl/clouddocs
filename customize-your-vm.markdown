# Customise your Virtual Machine

The HPC Cloud is offered as an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). That allows you to give your Virtual Machines (VMs) the _form_ that you need them to have.

You can customise your VMs by editing the `template`s you instantiate the VMs from.

## Editing a template

In order to edit an existing template, under the _Virtual Resources_ menu, choose the _Templates_ item. This will show a list of available `template`s. Click on the one you want to edit. Extended information about that image will be displayed within two tabs: _Info_ and _Template_. 

Above this extended information area, there are 3 buttons. One of them says _Update_. If you click there, you will be able to edit the _template_. Do it now; the button will become green and, to its right, you will see 2 modes for editing the _template_: a _Wizard_ mode and an _Advanced_ one. We will be describing here the _Wizard_ mode. 

> **NOTE:**
>
> We will talk about the _Wizard_ mode here. The _Advanced_ one can be handy to see a full summary of the template, and it is also a good view to copy-and-paste templates in case you need to.

Whenever you are finished customising your template, make sure you **click on the green _Update_ button so that your changes are actually saved**.

The tabs for editing a template are the following:
 * [General options](customize-vm-general)
 * [Storage options](customize-vm-storage)
 * [Network options](customize-vm-network)
 * [OS Booting options](customize-vm-boot)
 * [Input/Output options](customize-vm-io)
 * [Context options](customize-vm-context)
 * [Other options](customize-vm-other)
