This is part Extras of the tutorial [UNESCO-IHE symposium 2017-03-30&31](.). These exercises can be done in any order and you are to do as many as you want, depending on your enthusiasm and available time.

You will find several _Food for brain_ questions in each exercise about situations that you might encounter when working with **Parallel programming** techniques. Our advice is that you perform many tests, observe the results (write down execution times, change parameters, make tables, draw graphs...) and think about your answers.

>**NOTE:**
>
> You should have completed (and understood) both [Part A](partA) and [Part B](partB) before trying these extras.

## OpenMP

Link: [OpenMP: calculating _&pi;_](OpenMP)
  
  Using a simple algorithm to calculate _&pi;_ as an example, you will see the impact of the **scale-up** model and parallel programming with OpenMP.

## MPI

Link: [MPI: Wave equation](MPI)

  Using a numerical method to calculate wave propagation as an example, you will see the impact of both **scale-up** and **scale-out** models and parallel programming with MPI.
  
## XML-RPC

Link: [XML-RPC](XMLRPC)
  
  Experience the automation API that OpenNebula provides, which can be used to find out a lot of information about your own environment, and to operate with VMs in a non-interactive way.
