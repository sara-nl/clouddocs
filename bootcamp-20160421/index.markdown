## <a name="general"></a>General Information 
This session is delivered within the Computing Track of the [SURF Research Bootcamp](https://www.surf.nl/academy/surf-research-bootcamp).

SURFsara has been operating the HPC Cloud as `IaaS` (Infrastructure as a Service) for several years. 
Since recently we have launched a new HPC Cloud with a powerful new user interface and a complete new cluster with fast compute nodes and high-performant big storage volumes. 
The user interface and cloud software relies on [OpenNebula 4](http://opennebula.org/) and our new cluster is called _Oort_, after the [Oort cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oort_cloud).

This particular course aims to introduce the workshop participants to the HPC Cloud by providing a set of lectures and hands-on examples to run on the real **`Oort`** infrastructure. 
Here is a summary of the course outline:

**Date**: 21st April 2016  
**Location**: Marinus Ruppertgebouw op de Leuvenlaan 21, Utrecht.  

### Agenda
>12:30 Presentation: HPC Cloud at SURFsara (Ander Astudillo)  
13:00 Hands-on introduction (Markus van Dijk)  
13:10 Hands-on
14:30 End  

## <a name="preparation"></a>Preparation

Participants should bring a laptop with Internet connection and a proper browser. 
Prior experience in [Linux commands](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/) will help but is not a prerequisite. 

So what you need for this tutorial:

* A computer with full Internet access. The room provides WiFi.
* A browser (Chrome or Firefox will do nicely).
* An SSH client.
  * Linux and Mac users: don't have to install anything. The SSH client is on board, try "ssh" in a [terminal](http://askubuntu.com/questions/38162/what-is-a-terminal-and-how-do-i-open-and-use-it).
  * Windows users: download and install [git for windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/). Depending on your OS installation, choose between the `-32-bit.exe` or the `-64-bit.exe`.


## <a name="hands-on"></a> Hands-on
The hands-on tutorial has two parts. The exercises in part *A* will give you a first grasp for the `basic` usage of HPC Cloud. Once you have completed and understood this, then continue to the *Extras* part with more `advanced` examples on the HPC Cloud. 

  * [Part A](partA)
  * Extras:
    * [Extras - _&pi;_](extraPI)
    * [Extras - Detach from Work](extraDetachWork)
