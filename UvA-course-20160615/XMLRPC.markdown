This is an exercise from the [Extras](extras) part of the Tutorial [UvA course 2016-06-15](.).

In this advanced part of our HPC Cloud tutorial we ask you to play around with the **XML RPC** API.

### a) Setting up a VM for the exercise

You are now in the advanced part; you should be able to do this on your own.

### b) Run a first example

This exercise should make you familiar with our general documentation pages.

* On our general documentation, find the _Getting started with the XML-RPC_ page.

* Follow the instructions to prepare your Python environment with the Python bindings for the API, on the VM you prepared on the previous section.

* Run the first example from that documentation page. Make sure you are able to see the API version number as a result.

### c) Run a second example

* Run the example from the presentation that shows a list of your VMs.

> **_Food for brain:_**
>
> * Can you now modify the VM list to show **only** the running VMs?
> * Can you make a program that will shutdown all your VMs except the one you are running the program from?
